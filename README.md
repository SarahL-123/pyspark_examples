# pyspark_examples
I'm learning Pyspark, so this has some example code for how to do simple things.
I'm also trying to get better at git, so I'll use this project to make branches, merge them.etc

interfaces.py: Parent class that just loads data and has a decorator that prints the class/function name
example_data_cleaning.py: add rows, remove rows, filter, create columns, rename columns.etc
example_model_fit_save_load.py: Makes a logistic regression model, trains it, saves it to a file, then loads it again and predicts something with it
